# FriendFinder
#### An entertainment application which matches individuals of similar interests based on survey results.

## Usage
Follow the [Heroku Link](https://lit-beach-26020.herokuapp.com/) to take the survey. After the user submits their name and a picture link, they take the survey. They are asked to rate 10 statements on a scale of 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). After completing the survey, the application searches stored data and returns the individual with the closest matching answers.

## Tech Used
To create this app, I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Node, Express and Heroku.
